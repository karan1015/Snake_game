Snake Game - Classic Arcade Fun with Python & Pygame
----------------------------------------------------
Step into the world of retro gaming with my Python-based Snake Game! Built using the Pygame library, this project brings back the timeless arcade classic where players guide a snake to collect food, grow in size, and navigate through increasingly challenging levels. But watch out! Hitting the wall or biting your own tail means game over.

Features:
---------

Smooth Movement & Controls: Use arrow keys to seamlessly maneuver the snake around the game board.
Dynamic Gameplay: As you collect food, the snake grows longer, adding a layer of strategy and reflex to avoid self-collision.
Score Tracking: Keep tabs on your high score and challenge yourself to beat your personal best.
Play Again Option: After the game ends, instantly restart or quit with simple keypress options.
